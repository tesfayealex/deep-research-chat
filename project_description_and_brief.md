# PRD: Deep Research Agent Application

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements for a Deep Research Agent application. The goal is to create a tool that assists users in conducting in-depth research on specified topics. The application will feature an advanced chat interface for interaction and a robust backend powered by LLMs and search tools to automate the research process.

## 2. Goals

*   Develop an application that can autonomously plan, execute, process, refine, and report on research tasks based on user prompts.
*   Provide an intuitive and interactive chat-based UI for users to initiate research requests and view results.
*   Leverage modern AI orchestration frameworks (like Langflow concepts) and specialized search APIs (like Tavily) for effective information gathering and processing.
*   Create a system capable of handling complex queries that require multi-step reasoning and information synthesis.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Researchers, analysts, students, content creators, and knowledge workers who need to gather and synthesize information from various sources efficiently.

## 4. Core Functionality: The Research Cycle

The agent's primary function follows a cyclical process:

1.  **Plan:** Based on the user's request, the agent breaks down the research task into logical steps or sub-queries.
2.  **Execute:** The agent executes each step, often involving querying search engines (e.g., Tavily) or other data sources.
3.  **Process:** The agent analyzes the retrieved information, extracts relevant data, and synthesizes findings for each step.
4.  **Refine/Redo:** The agent evaluates the progress and the quality of information gathered. If necessary, it refines the plan, modifies search queries, or re-executes steps to improve results.
5.  **Report:** The agent compiles the processed information from all steps into a coherent report or answer, presented to the user through the chat interface.

## 5. High-Level Architecture

*   **Frontend:** A web-based chat interface (inspired by Vercel AI Chatbot) built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React/Next.js).
*   **Backend:** An API service (e.g., Python with FastAPI/Flask) that handles user requests, orchestrates the research agent, interacts with LLMs, and integrates with external tools (Langflow for flow management, Tavily for search).
*   **Agent Core:** Logic implementing the "Plan-Execute-Process-Refine-Report" cycle, potentially using frameworks like LangChain/LangGraph or custom logic orchestrated via Langflow.
*   **External Tools:**
    *   LLM(s) for planning, processing, refining, and reporting.
    *   Tavily API for optimized web searches.
    *   Langflow (or similar) for defining and managing the agent's workflow.

## 6. Key Inspirations

*   **Frontend UI/UX:** Vercel AI Chatbot (`https://chat.vercel.ai/`, `https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot`)
*   **Backend Agent Logic/Tool Integration:** R1 Reasoning RAG (`https://github.com/deansaco/r1-reasoning-rag/`) demonstrating Langflow + Tavily integration.
